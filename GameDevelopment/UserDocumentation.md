## Controls

Initialize audio

Press **"A" (Circle button)** or **"B" (X button)** to initialize a set of random words or numbers. These buttons can be pressed again to generate new random positions (update) **as well as new colors**.

NEW: **Lift controller up and around to change camera position!**
(Accelerameter use!)

**Use joycons to zoom and rotate**
- (The best way to get a "still" moment is to hold the left joycon in one position while moving the right joycon any way you wish, similar to how in a video game you would want one joycon to move you forward and the other for directional viewing)

**Right shoulder** to increase speed

**Right trigger** to decrease
- (This will also control frequency of the noise)

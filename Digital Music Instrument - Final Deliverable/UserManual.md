# SYLVIA
### How to Interact

Sylvia at its core functions like a midi controller. It has two midi sensors that are activated through body contact, ideally a finger.

These midi triggers can be programmed however you like. Currently they are set to MIDI channels 10 and 11. I am providing a Max patch that routes the two triggers to some funky sounding homemade synths. You can use them however you wish.

Type as normal. Sylvia is not meant to be making music at every second, rather, allowing space for the user to enjoy the sounds of both the typewriter and the occasional musical elements that come from pressing important keys, which are in this case the **period** and the **backspace,** where the triggers lie.

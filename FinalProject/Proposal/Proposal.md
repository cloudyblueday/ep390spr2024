# Sylvia
### Dylan Ever EP390 Instrument Proposal
*Typewriter Instrument*

**Sylvia** will be an enhanced analog typewriter made to produce both word and sound. The goal is to be able to write on the typewriter while also triggering sounds on specific meaningful keys. I am not aiming to create a midi keyboard, or a machine that produces sounds corresponding with the ASCII keys that it has. Rather, it is meant to augment performances of writing and poetry with intentional keys being linked to sound. The instrument is also supposed to be simple to allow the typewriter to remain in working order. 

Factoid: the instrument is named for beloved author Sylvia Plath. Her story makes me sad. I'm trying to write her a better one.
    
### Features Achieved No Matter What
* Four capacitive sensors on the typewriter that are customizable and MIDI capable (2/4 achieved)
* Some way to read the typewritten product (either video or making sure that the poem can be read after the fact)
* An accompanying max patch that turns the four sensors into a musical instrument (kinda sorta there)

### Better Outcome Deliverable
* Sensitivity for each key, allowing more expression
* Sensors on slightly more unordinary parts of the typewriter, like the return bar
* A small separate controller that can recongifigre the sensors, akin to using a function key (fn + another key) so that one sensor can be used for multiple functions

### Best Outcome Deliverable
* Some very thin capacitive sensors (or maybe computervision) that just translate the typewriter output to a digital keyboard, so that text can be written digitally as well as analog
* I feel like the best outcome will come out of a very well soldered and studded-out set up, that requires probably some more equipment than I have, and more knowledge, too. (I am currently a bit spooked to travel with it. Ideally I want it to be where you can just put the typewriter back in its original case.)


### Next Steps, Additional Skills
I have already managed two working capacitive sensors on my typewriter. Currently, I'm struggling to get up to four. (You know this haha) This, as well as trying to modify the sensors to work on stranger keys of the typewriter, is my hardest physical aspect. Also, it's a little "finnicky" right now, and a lot of the hard work is trying to stabilize it.

The other largest, probably hardest part for me, is the Max patch. Frankly, the typewriter instrument itself is just some customizable buttons, and I'm not sure if that cuts it. The Max patch needs to have a lot of weight and I am... just not that creative yet with Max! Basically the patch relies on the capacitive sensors providing bangs to progress a melodic idea, so I'm really just trying to learn how to be one of those generative music Max wizards. Not easy!

I will be really happy if: I can get four sensors going, and make a Max patch that can progress through a compositional idea by way of just receiving four different triggers. 

And if I can figure out some way to stream input from the typewriter's paper. It's really really hard to put a camera there and see what is actually being written. I wonder if there is some better way to go about that. Right now I'm honestly just considering focusing on the auditory experience of hearing the typewriter keys + whatever sound I'm generating, and then just finishing the paper, pulling out the poem, and reading it. (Cause I have not found a successful way to stream the "analog" output of the typewriter yet) I might need a serious tripod, or to even take some parts off of my typewriter (which I am a bit scared to do)
